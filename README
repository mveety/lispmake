lispmake -- shitty makefiles for lisp

How to build:
if you have lispmake: lispmake ; lisp --load build.lisp
if you have lispmake rev 11 or higher: lispmake
if you don't have lispmake: lisp --load bootstrap.lisp

Targets:
	By default lispmake looks for the file "LMakefile". If it doesn't
	exist it just crashes and has lisp handle it. Targets are just
	extensions to the default name. So if you want an install
	target you make a file called "LMakefile.install" and run
	lispmake like "lispmake install".

Other Files:
	Lispmake also handles using other files instead of the LMakefile.
	if you invoke lispmake like "lispmake file=[filename]" it
	allows you to use that to build. Targets still work with the
	normal convention of [filename].[target] .

REVISION 14 NOTES:
	This version will likely require bootstrapping if coming from a
	previous revision. Run bootstrap.lisp in your lisp of choice then
	you can run ./lispmake install to get lispmake installed.
	LMakefiles from previous versions might require some changes to
	get up to date, your mileage may vary. This will be a rare event
	and I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

REVISION 14 CHANGES:
	BUG FIXES! <3
	Ability for user to define variables (via :configure)
	Ability to define variables via command line
	Ability to check for required file (via :require-file)
	:install works correctly now.
	Ability to print output to stdout (via :echo)
	Ability to execute lisp code inside of lispmake (via :eval)
	Ability to override the build time lisp implementation
		(via command line variable lisp=)
	:delete works correctly now and prints out each operation.
	Output files are named based on the target their generated from
	Command line arguments are considered targets unless they're assignments
	Files are only generated if :generate is evaluated.
	Executable output forms are only generated if package and toplevel are set.
