lispmake -- shitty makefiles for lisp

How to build:
if you have lispmake: lispmake ; lisp --load build.lisp
if you have lispmake rev 11 or higher: lispmake
if you don't have lispmake: lisp --load bootstrap.lisp

Targets:
    By default lispmake looks for the file "LMakefile". If it doesn't
    exist it just crashes and has lisp handle it. Targets are just
    extensions to the default name. So if you want an install
    target you make a file called "LMakefile.install" and run
    lispmake like "lispmake --target=install".

Other Files:
    Lispmake also handles using other files instead of the LMakefile.
    if you invoke lispmake like "lispmake --file=[filename]" it
    allows you to use that to build. Targets still work with the
    normal convention of [filename].[target] .

REVISION 12 ADDITIONS:
	 Ability to use files other than LMakefile

	 Now requires quicklisp (sorry!)
	 Ability to run other executables (:exec ("cp" "lispmake" "/usr/local/bin/"))
	 More Broken

REVISION 11 ADDITIONS:
	 Ability to build with lispmake (no more running sbcl --load)
	 Ton of cleanups
	 Quicklisp integration works better
	 File definitions work better
	 Less Broken

REVISION 10 ADDITIONS:
	 Added support for creating fasl files
